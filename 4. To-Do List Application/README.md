# âœ… To-Do List Application in Java

A simple command-line Java program to manage tasks, mark them as done, and keep your daily to-do list organized.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- Remove existing tasks by number.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- List all tasks with their status (done or pending).
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully with clear prompts.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file.
2. Compile the program with a Java compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   javac ToDoList.java
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   java ToDoList
4. Follow the on-screen menu to manage your tasks.

## How it Works

- Users interact via a simple numbered menu.
- Tasks are stored in two lists: one for task descriptions and one for completion status.
- Tasks can be added, removed, or marked as done using the menu options.
- The list displays [X] for completed tasks and [ ] for pending tasks.
- The computer choice is randomly generated each round.
