# ðŸ“š Library Management System in Java

A simple command-line Java program to manage books in a library. Users can add, issue, return, and list books with clear status updates.

## Features

- Add new books with title and author.
- Issue books to mark them as borrowed.
- Return books to mark them as available.
- List all books with their current status (Issued / Available).
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.
  
## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file.
2. Compile the program with a Java compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   javac LibraryManagementSystem.java
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   java LibraryManagementSystem
4. Follow the on-screen menu to manage library books.

1984                           George Orwell         Issued
```

## How It Works

- Users interact with a numbered menu to manage library operations.
- Books are stored in an ArrayList with title, author, and issue status.
- Users can add, issue, or return books, and the system tracks which books are currently issued.
- The book list shows [Issued] or [Available] for easy reference.
- The computer choice is randomly generated each round.
