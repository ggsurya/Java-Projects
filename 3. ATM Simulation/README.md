# üè¶ ATM Simulation in Java
A simple command-line Java program simulating basic ATM operations like checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing money.

## Features

- User authentication via PIN (demo PIN: 1234).
- Check current account balance.
- Deposit money into the account.
- Withdraw money from the account with balance validation.
- Handles invalid inputs and limits PIN attempts to 3.
- Simple text-based menu for easy interaction.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file.

2. Compile the program with a Java compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   javac ATMSimulation.java
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   java ATMSimulation
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the ATM.

## Example

```
(For demo purpose, please use this PIN: 1234)

Enter your PIN: 1234

ATM Menu:
1. Check Balance

## How It Works

- Users have 3 attempts to enter the correct PIN.
- After successful login, a menu is displayed with options:
  - Check Balance
  - Deposit
  - Withdraw
  - Exit
- Deposits increase the account balance, withdrawals decrease it (if sufficient funds).
- Invalid choices or amounts are handled gracefully.
- The computer choice is randomly generated each round.
